# How to run program

To run the program, once this repo is cloned, type in the cmd line g++ BarrenAnalysis.cc -o barren.   
Then to execute, type ./barren.   
The program will prompt you to enter the coordiantes of the rectangle.  
To enter each coordinate, type: X1 Y1 X2 Y2.  
Then hit enter to insert the next set of coordinates.  
Once you're finished entering the coordinates, press 'e' to end user input.  

# Testing

Need to have framework Catch2 installed. This is the Github repo link: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.  
I chose this framework for its simplicity of implementation for testing in C++.  
Once installed, need to do a cmake for Catch2.
To run in the command line, use g++ BarrenAnalysis_tests.cc -o test -std=c++11. Then ./test to execute.
