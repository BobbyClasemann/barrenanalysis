# Running the program

Clone this repo: https://github.com/BobbyClasemann/barrenanalysis.git  
Go to the directory where this repository is cloned in your terminal.  
Assuming you have the required dependencies installed, type the following in your terminal: g++ src/BarrenAnalysis.cc -o barren     
To execute, type ./barren     
The program will prompt you to enter the coordiantes of the rectangle.  
To enter each coordinate, type "X1 Y1 X2 Y2"  where X1, X2 are values 0-399 and Y1, Y2 are values 0-599.  
Then hit enter to insert the next set of coordinates.  
Once you're finished entering the coordinates, press 'e' to end user input. 
Once the program has finished running, it should display the area of the fertile land in ascending order.
